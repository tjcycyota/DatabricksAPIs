# DatabricksAPIs
Short demo notebooks showing common methods on Databricks APIs

# Intro
The notebooks contained in this repo showcase some of the common methods on Databricks APIs: 
* These are intended to be run from **within** the target workspace. You can of course interact externally with tools like Postman, CURL, Python Requests library, etc. The methods/payloads required for each API call will be identical.
* The easiest way to use these examples is to import the entire repository as a [Databricks Repo](https://docs.databricks.com/repos.html). This repositoryand should be importable to any Databricks workspace (network settings/admin controls allowing). 
* The examples are non-exhaustive. More examples will be added over time. Please feel free to submit a PR or fork for your own uses.
